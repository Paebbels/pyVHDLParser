0. Pass - Preprocessing
#######################

.. note::
   Currently, pyVHDLParser doesn't implement any pre-processing steps. It accepts
   either an input filename or a string as content.


.. rubric:: Possible Use Cases

The following pre-processing steps could be envisions:

* Conditional analysis (new since VHDL-2019)
* File decryption according to IEEE Std. 1735-2014
